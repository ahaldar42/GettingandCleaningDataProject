Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Amrita Haldar

Repo created for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins University "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ones ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set that can be used for later analysis.

Making Modifications to This Script

Once the data files have been downloaded and unzipped, one modification has to be made to the R file before the data can be processed. 
Note that on line 6 of run_analysis.R, path of the working directory has be to set to reflect the location of the source files in the directory.

Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
